                    Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː, -daɪ/). They are classified as caniforms, 
                    or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in 
                    a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern 
                    Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common 
                    characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, 
                    shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

            <h3>Lion</h3>

                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
                broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually 
                dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, 
                forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups 
                of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone 
                predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions 
                typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

            <h3>Shark</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Male_whale_shark_at_Georgia_Aquarium.jpg" alt="Standing Bear" height="150" width="200">
            <p>
                Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits
                on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified 
                within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). 
                Some sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes 
                (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as 
                Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some 
                fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million years ago).[1] 
                The oldest confirmed modern sharks (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic, about 200 million 
                years ago, though records of true sharks may extend back as far as the Permian.
