            <p>
                Once found throughout south-east Asia, Javan rhinos have suffered a staggering decline in their numbers
                due to hunting and habitat loss. The lone wild population of Javan rhinos is one of the rarest of the
                rhino species—around 75 individuals—which can only be found on the island of Java, Indonesia.

            <p>
                The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, with only around 100 individuals left in
                the wild. Although their wild population seems to be stable and increasing, these leopard subspecies are
                still critically endangered since 1996. And there is a good reason that: Amur leopards can only be found
                in a relatively small region of the far east of Russia and north-eastern China at present. Ï

            <h2>SUNDA ISLAND TIGER</h2>
            <p>The Sunda Island tiger, or the Sumatran tiger, is the smallest tiger subspecies in the world, weighing up
                to 140kg. For reference, the tigers that live in the Amur region are the biggest of all the big cats
                where males can weigh up to twice as much as Sunda Island tigers. They are also very rare - there are
                estimated to be around 600 in the wild, and are only found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. </p>
