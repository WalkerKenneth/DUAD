        <p>Blogging is far from dead. As the last 12 months of Twitter—sorry, X—drama have shown, allowing a social
            media platform to control your audience has risks. If you want a platform where you can share your thoughts
            properly and keep control of things, it's impossible to beat a blog. Plus, you can always share your blog
            posts on social media.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources and recommendations to customers, the best way
            to do it is often to add a blog to your website. Best of all, your blog content gets indexed by
            Google—unlike almost all social media posts—so you can drive potential customers to your business through
            content marketing (and without having to pay for ads). Look at the blog you're reading right now: Zapier
            blog posts get millions of views per month and are one of the most valuable ways of getting new customers at
            Zapier.</p>
        <p>After testing all the most popular blog sites out there, these are the five best. And yes, two of them are
            WordPress, but there are a few great WordPress alternatives in here too.</p>
